# Twitter quotes bot

An automated botðŸ¤– that posts Inspirational quotes 2 times a day in your Twitter timeline.

## Motivation behind

When we scroll through our Twitter timeline we get inspired by some of the tweets we see. but we don't find that kind of tweets often. This situation gave birth to this bot. where it keeps motivating us by posting random inspirational quotes daily at 11:11 AM and 11:11PM (All the times were in IST).
